# <center> Telecom Retention | Customer Churn Analysis | Churn Prediction 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the most common issues, widely faced by any kind of industry, is retaining their customers, which is a challenging task (be it the telecom industry, gaming industry, etc).

With the aim of customer retention, this project helps in identifying and understand the customer behaviour within the Telecom Industry, in order to identify the churning customers.


### Understanding the Different Types of Churn:

The concept of Customer Churn is not just limited to the shift made by a customer from availing the services/products of one firm to another. There are several ways in which a company may suffer a loss due to customer churn. There is: 
* Service Churn (for eg. downgrading from a monthly to a weekly subscription)
* Tariff Plan Churn (for eg. downgrading from a Rs. 100 plan to a Rs.50 plan)
* Product Churn (for eg. changing from postpaid to prepaid) 
* Usage Churn (for eg. inactive or zero usage ) <br>

These are specific to the telecom industry.  

### Different Churning Segments:

As per the decision cycle of a typical subscriber, four churn segments come into the picture:

1. __Conditionally Loyal__: Customers who have thought about churning > Are not locked in by their contract > Still decided to stay
2. __Conditional Churner__: Customers who have thought about churning > Are not locked in by their contract > Decide to leave because __they found a better option__ 
3. __Lifestyle Migrator__: Customers who have thought about churning > Are not locked in by their contract > Decide to leave because __their needs changed__
4. __Unsatisfied Churner__: Customers who have thought about churning > Are not locked in by their contract > Decide to leave because __they're not satisfied__

### Overview of a Data-Science Approach to manage churns:

__Capturing and Analysing Data > Reporting and Prediction > Engaging and Taking Action__

The ultimate goal is to identify the customers who are likely to be churned, along with their category of churn, so that we are able to tackle their issues and retain them as customers.
